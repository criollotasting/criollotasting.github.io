		    I never wanted to be a chef; people regarded it as barren, low. If I cooked for others they would ask, “Do you know how to make tamales?” or “How do you make green chile?”. I never truly found that inquiry offensive, regardless of its mild racism, or that my skin tone would spawn this deep wisdom in Latin cuisine. However, there always has been a part of my identity missing, something I never understood as a kid. Maybe it was that constant demand to learn about my heritage, or figure out what I really wanted to dedicate my life to, but at the end of the day I wanted to define the culture we live in. I found that responsibility in cooking; being a chef has made me want to be part of this conversation. 

	<br><br>If I was going to cook, what would my niche be? I can’t tell you how many experiences I have had in a restaurant, feeling completely separated from food. When a Chef gives you an underseasoned protein, or a sauce that isn't seasoned right, they resolve the issue by blaming the entire staff and doing it themselves; maybe it’s just being an asshole that’ll make the guest appreciate the $325 ticket brought to them at the end of the their meal. I’ve worked in that hierarchical system, the one that leaves the chef’s hands clean from any debate or scrutiny. The system that punishes those who know the least and praises the chef for his wisdom. I never wanted a cook or a server or a guest to feel so small, to feel as if they were shamed out of the process itself. 

	<br><br>When we started Criollo, our first and most important goal was to make others feel fostered. If it was natural to cook and serve food at home, why did it feel so ordinary and uncomfortable in a public setting? If you’re trying to connect, trying to share this concept and technique with someone, why wouldn’t you give the guest, or host, or cooks your wholehearted attention? The objective of these tastings, is to answer as many questions as we ask ourselves. How can we design an experience for the diner that emulates the ambiance of eating at home. Can you serve people food that was inspired by the greatest chef’s on the planet, course after course, without them feeling intimidated or that their confidence has been insulted? Having critiques and conversations after each of our dinners is crucial to the success Criollo. Being able to exchange ideas on dishes, understanding the gastronomy and science behind what we do is knowledge that we owe to every guest who eats here. Criollo is dependent on the opinions of its participants, and aspires to evolve respect for food itself.
