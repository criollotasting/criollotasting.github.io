                    <h2>About Us.</h2>
                   
		    I never wanted to be a chef; people regarded it as barren, low. If I cooked for others they would ask, “Do you know how to make tamales?” or “How do you make green chile?”. I never truly found that inquiry offensive, regardless of its mild racism, or that my skin tone would spawn this deep wisdom in Latin cuisine. However, there always has been a part of my identity missing, something I never understood as a kid. Maybe it was that constant demand to learn about my heritage, or figure out what I really wanted to dedicate my life to, but at the end of the day I wanted to define the culture we live in. I found that responsibility in cooking; being a chef has made me want to be part of this conversation. 

	<br><br>If I was going to cook, what would my niche be? I can’t tell you how many experiences I’ve had, going into a restaurant or up to a food truck window, feeling completely separated from food. When the “Modern Chef” gives you an underseasoned protein, or a flat sauce, resolving the issue requires blaming the entire staff, putting an apron on, and doing it themselves; maybe it’s just being an asshole that’ll make the guest appreciate the $325 prix fixe menu. I’ve worked in that hierarchical system, the one that leaves the chef’s hands clean from any debate or scrutiny. The system that punishes those who know the least and praises the chef for his wisdom. I never wanted a cook or a server or a guest to feel so small, to feel as if they were shamed out of the process. 

	<br><br>When we started Criollo, our first and most important goal was to make others feel fostered. If it was natural to cook and serve food at home, why did it feel so ordinary and uncomfortable in a public setting? If you’re trying to connect, trying to share this concept and technique with someone, why wouldn’t you give the guest, or host, or cooks your wholehearted attention? The objective of these tastings, is to answer as many questions as we ask ourselves. How can we design an experience for the diner that emulates the ambiance of eating at home. Can you serve people food that was inspired by the greatest chef’s on the planet, course after course, without them feeling intimidated or that their confidence has been insulted? Having critiques and conversations after each of our dinners is crucial to the success Criollo. Being able to exchange ideas on dishes, understanding the gastronomy and science behind what we do is knowledge that we owe to every guest who eats here. Criollo is dependent on the opinions of its participants, and aspires to evolve respect for food itself.

                    <h2>Rules.</h2>
                    This is the fun part.<br><br>
                <h3>Invitations &amp; Reservations.</h3>
                    - In order to receive an invitation (includes location, date, time, and a rough menu) you must sign up on this site using the form we have set up. These will, usually, be sent out 3 weeks to a month prior to the tasting date.<br>
                -To confirm your spot at a tasting once invitations are sent out, a $20 deposit is required via Venmo or Paypal per guest. Those who sign up with extra guests will be responsible for the deposits of their party. For those close to us, cash is also an option.<br>
                - If reservations exceed 12 guests for a tasting, the remaining guests will be waitlisted until a confirmed guest has cancelled. Those who are waitlisted and did not receive a spot will have priority at our next tasting.<br>
                -We do have an option for one guest to reserve spots for up to 3 other guests. Details can be seen in the form during sign up.<br><br>
                <h3>Cancellations.</h3>
                -Cancellations do happen, and we have a few extra rules for it.<br>
                --Cancellations made prior to 2 days before the tasting date will have their deposit refunded and their spot given to another guest. (To be more specific, the cancellation window without penalty is 2 days from the day of the tasting, not the time. That means, if a tasting is on the 6th at 7pm, starting midnight on the 4th is considered to be wthin the 2 day window.)<br>
                -Cancellations made within the 2 days will not get their deposit refunded.<br>
                -We strive to accumulate as little waste as possible, and we portion dishes to the number of confirmed guests as perfectly as possible. Therefore, we have a strict banning policy for guests that cancel within the 2 day window perpetually.<br>
                -For 2 last minute cancellations, you will be banned from the next 3 tastings.<br>
                -For 3 last minute cancellations, you will be banned from the next 6 tastings.<br>
                -For 4 last minute cancellations, you will be permanently banned from paricipating in another tasting.<br><br>
                <h3>Donations.</h3>
                -We do not charge guests a flat rate, or a "restuarant" rate to come to our tastings.<br>
                -We do use the honor system, and allow guests to determine the amount they believe we deserve.<br>
                -As suggested by those who have participated in past tastings, we will give suggestions that will cover our food cost. This will be sent out to guests via email when we determine the final version of the menu.<br><br>
                <h3>General info.</h3>
                -Attire is considered "casually elegant". We'll let you decide what that means.<br>
                -There will be an option on the form to check off "booze" if you decide to bring a form of it to the tasting. Booze is not considered a donation and can not be used as a discount. This is purely for guests wanting to bring something to pair with our menu if they'd like to.<br>
                -Parking is, generally, suburban/street parking.<br>
                -We do accomodate those with dietary allergies and preferences, and have a section of the form that allows for guests to tell us.<br>
                -Guests will need to consent to being photographed at the tastings during sign up. These will mostly be used for us to figure out seating and decorations for the next tasting. They may also be used on our site, though we try very hard not to pick photos with a singular guest, or photos with clear faces. If there comes a time where there is demand for a social media account, we will use photographs that are consented under a new policy and not the policy we have in place right now.<br> 
		    -For those bringing additional guests with them, you are also consenting your guests under our terms and conditions when you sign them up with you. We will have a guestbook that all guests will sign upon arriving.<br>
